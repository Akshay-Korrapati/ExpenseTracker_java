INITIAL: 

Make an initial java program which can take input of the transactions of an individual, make an initial expenses class and a few sub-classes of it using inheritance. each subclass is of different type: 

1. salary
2. standard monthly expenses: 
	1. rent
	2. insurances
	3. Maid etc.
	4. loans
3. Missilaneous

Then we will make a main class which tracks and analyses the amount kept being used by the user on a regular basis and how is his performance based on his spending and income. 

We will use a excel file or an sql file to keep track of the money flow.
